In this class i have learned several things about **git** and **github**.
The branch segment is completely new to me as the last group project i worked on, we all worked on the main branch.
One thing im still having trouble with is the idea of keeping up with what everyone is working on at the same time and how it effects my code.
Also the *pascal* and *camel* casing which will just take time to learn
